# Software-Test-Automation-And-QA

# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
First, I will have to read and understand the requirements of my program. I would then tailor my tests to make sure that each of those requirements are satisfied in my program. Then, I would test for any security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or improper access control etc..

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I would have to first talk to the client to see what their end goal is with the program. I can then begin to ask questions to draw out any features that the client must have for their program. I can even supply some ideas since I will most likely know more about the technical aspects of designing a system.

# How do I approach designing software?
I have a top down approach. I like to get a feel for what is trying to be achieved first and then break it down into small chunks. I would design a part of the system and test it before moving on to the next. When all the features have been designed, I would then put it all together and do an integration and stress test to make sure everything still works as intended.
